    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",
    "* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.\n",

    "It is assumed that the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, therefore the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time when it is successfully detected all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the tested image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In $3rd$ cell, the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` are used to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function. Then this distortion correction is applied to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",
